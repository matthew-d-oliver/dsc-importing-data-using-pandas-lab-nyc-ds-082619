    "In this lab, you'll get some practice with loading files with summary or metadata, and if you find that easy, the optional \"level up\" content covers loading data from a corrupted csv file!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Import data from csv files and Excel files\n",
    "* Understand and explain key arguments for imports\n",
    "* Save information to csv and Excel files\n",
    "* Access data within a Pandas DataFrame (print() and .head())\n",

    "##  Loading Files with Summary or Meta Data\n",
    "\n",
